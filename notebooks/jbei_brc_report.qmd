# Objective
Analyses for determining a microbial "core" using ASV contribution to Bray-Curtis dissimilarity.

# Setup
```{r}
#| label: setup

# Set CRAN mirror
options(repos = c(CRAN = "https://cloud.r-project.org"))

source(here::here("R/utils/000_setup.R"))
if (exists("phyloseq")) remove(phyloseq)
```

# Microbiome Core Selection via `extract_core()` in all BRCs

To obtain the microbial core determined by ASV's contribution to Bray-Curtis dissimilarity, we:

- Pruned samples
  - Used `prune_samples` and `sample_sums` to remove any samples that had fewer than 100 total reads

- Filtered ASVs based on read counts
  - Used `filter_taxa` function to keep only ASVs that had:
    - More than 20 reads in at least one sample

All these steps were performed in `002_phyloseq.R` not shown here.

After which we:
- Extracted the core microbiome across different sites
  - Parameters:
    - Variable of interest was "site"
    - Used an "increase" method
    - With an increase value of 2

# Microbiome Core Selection via `extract_core()` in JBEI dataset

Now let's looks at the JBEI dataset subsetted from the filtered_phyloseq which contains all BRCs and was submitted to DADA2 pipeline and filtered as one data set. *The result is a phyloseq object with 59,961 ASvs and 16 samples.*

```{mermaid}

    B --> C[filtered_phyloseq<br/>All BRCs Dataset]
    C -->|subset_samples<br/>brc == 'jbei'| D[JBEI Dataset]
    subgraph "Initial Processing"
        A
        B
    end
    subgraph "Filtering Steps"
        C
        style C fill:#fff,stroke:#333
    end
    subgraph "Final Dataset"
        D
        style D fill:#fff,stroke:#333
    end
```

```{r}
#| label: process-JBEI-data

# Subsetting
jbei_phyloseq <- phyloseq::subset_samples(
  filtered_phyloseq,
  brc == "jbei"
)

# Core selection and plots
filtered_jbei_core <- core_select_pipeline(
  jbei_phyloseq,
  .title = "JBEI Core Microbial Community ranked",
  .subtitle = "Core that contributes 2% to Bray-Curtis (subset from All BRCs)"
)

# Print
filtered_jbei_core$bc_curve_threshold

filtered_jbei_core$occupancy_plot

```

Notice the odd pattern! Not a smotth curve. It should look like the previous plot. The data is structure the same way. 

Let's look at the JBEI dataset filtered and prepared by Yen.

# JBEI core microbiome (Yen's version)

Here we cleaned up the data set a little bit to make sure that the data type were the same as previous data set.Ruling out data type as an issue.

We then filtered for minimum sample reads and ASV read counts in the same manner. *The result is a phyloseq object with 2,213 ASvs and 16 samples.*
We have about ~10 core ASVs.

```{r}
#| label: process-JBE-YEN-data

# # Minor clean up
# new_metadata <- drought_jbei %>%
#   sample_data() %>%
#   as_tibble() %>%
#   janitor::clean_names() %>%
#   mutate(
#     across(brc, ~ str_to_lower(.)),
#     across(everything(.), ~ as.character(.)),
#     new_row = x_sample_id
#   ) %>%
#   column_to_rownames(., var = "new_row") %>% # Workaround to inserting "sa1" type rownames
#   sample_data()

# # Update phyloseq object
# sample_data(drought_jbei) <- new_metadata

# Filter
drought_jbei_filtered_20 <- filter_phyloseq(
  drought_jbei,
  min_sample_reads = 100,
  min_asv_reads = 20
)

# Core selection and plots
jbei_yen_core_20 <- core_select_pipeline(
  drought_jbei_filtered_20,
  .title = "JBEI-Yen's Core Microbial Community ranked",
  .subtitle = "Core that contributes 2% to Bray-Curtis (Yen's drought data)"
)

# Print
jbei_yen_core_20$bc_curve_threshold

jbei_yen_core_20$occupancy_plot
```

Looking at the data closely, Phillip and I noticed that there ar many repeated read counts at low levels <100 reads. For example, we saw many ASV that had only 21 reads. They also formed a diagonal pattern. Much like a comparison matrix.

Does increasing the filtering parameters help? Let's change the minimum ASV reads counts.

```{r}
# Filter
drought_jbei_filtered_100 <- filter_phyloseq(
  drought_jbei,
  min_sample_reads = 100,
  min_asv_reads = 100
)

## Core selection and plots
jbei_yen_core_100 <- core_select_pipeline(
  drought_jbei_filtered_100,
  .title = "JBEI-Yen's Core Microbial Community ranked",
  .subtitle = "Core that contributes 2% to Bray-Curtis (>= 100 reads)"
)

# Print
jbei_yen_core_100$bc_curve_threshold

jbei_yen_core_100$occupancy_plot

```

*The result is a phyloseq object with 473 ASVs and 16 samples.* We have about ~10 core ASVs.

It still doesn't look great.

# Analyzing read patterns for JBEI
## Analysis Across Filtering Levels

```{r}
# Define the datasets and their labels
datasets <- list(
  original = list(
    data = drought_jbei,
    label = "Yen's original data"
  ),
  filtered_20 = list(
    data = drought_jbei_filtered_20,
    label = "More than 20 reads per ASV"
  ),
  filtered_100 = list(
    data = drought_jbei_filtered_100,
    label = "More than 100 reads per ASV"
  )
)

# Define common threshold values
thresholds <- c(60, 70, 80, 90)
```

```{r}
# Apply analysis to each dataset
invisible(lapply(datasets, function(dataset) {
  analyze_dataset(dataset$data, dataset$label)
}))
```


Concerning Patterns Identified:

1. High frequency of exactly 21 reads in multiple ASVs
2. Diagonal pattern formation in read count distribution
3. "matrix-like" pattern at low read counts (<100)

These patterns strongly suggest:

* Potential technical artifacts in the sequencing or processing pipeline
* Possible cross-contamination between samples
* Risk of false positive ASVs
* ***Selection of "core" with this method is not adequate due to sample size***

An ASV present with 21 reads in one sample contribution is proportionally greater. Bray-Curstis dissimilarity is sensitive to this. 


## PERMANOVA (dbRDA)

Code from Yen. Use `drought_JBEI.rds` with transformed sample counts (relative abundance)

```{r}
# import and compute bray-curtis distance
ps_jbei <- readRDS("data/output/phyloseq_objects/jbei/drought_JBEI.rds")

ps_rel <- transform_sample_counts(ps_jbei, function(x) x / sum(x))
BC.dist <- vegan::vegdist(t(otu_table(ps_rel)), method = "bray")

## permanova looking at harvest and treatment effect
vegan::adonis2(
  BC.dist ~ Harvest * Treatment,
  data = data.frame(sample_data(ps_rel)),
  nperm = 1000,
  method = "bray",
  by = "terms"
)

## remove harvest effect
vegan::adonis2(
  BC.dist ~ Treatment,
  data = data.frame(sample_data(ps_rel)),
  nperm = 1000,
  method = "bray",
  by = "terms",
  strata = sample_data(ps_rel)$Harvest
)
```


## Applying `adonis2 analysis to filtered datasets
```{r}
# Phyloseq objects to analyze
ps_list <- list(
  filtered_jbei = jbei_phyloseq,
  filtered_20 = drought_jbei_filtered_20,
  filtered_100 = drought_jbei_filtered_100
)

formulas <- list(
  full_model = "harvest * treatment",
  treatment_only = "treatment"
)
# Strata
strata_vars <- list(
  full_model = NULL,
  treatment_only = "harvest"
)

# Replicating Yen's results
run_adonis2_analysis(ps_jbei, formula = "Harvest * Treatment")

run_adonis2_analysis(ps_jbei, formula = "Treatment", strata = "Harvest")
```


### PERMANOVA on filtered datasets

```{r}
results_all <- map(ps_list, function(ps) {
  map(formulas, ~ run_adonis2_analysis(ps, formula = .x))
})


results_with_strata <- map(ps_list, function(ps) {
  map2(formulas, strata_vars, function(form, strat) {
    run_adonis2_analysis(ps, formula = form, strata = strat)
  })
})

# # Access results
results_all
results_with_strata
```
